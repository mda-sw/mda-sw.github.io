   where options =  

        [-t type_of_multiresolution_transform]
              1: linear wavelet transform: a trous algorithm 
              2: bspline wavelet transform: a trous algorithm 
              3: wavelet transform in Fourier space 
              4: morphological median transform 
              5: morphological minmax transform 
              6: pyramidal linear wavelet transform 
              7: pyramidal bspline wavelet transform 
              8: pyramidal wavelet transform in Fourier space: algo 1 
                 (diff. between two resolutions) 
              9: pyramidal wavelet transform in Fourier space: algo 2 
                 (diff. between the square of two resolutions) 
              10: pyramidal median transform 
              11: pyramidal laplacian 
              12: morphological pyramidal minmax transform 
              13: decomposition on scaling function 
              14: Mallat's wavelet transform (7/9 filters) 
              15: Feauveau's wavelet transform 
              16: Feauveau's wavelet transform without undersampling 
              17: G transform (morphological min-max algorithm) 
              18: Haar's wavelet transform 
             default is bspline wavelet transform: a trous algorithm

         [-n number_of_scales]
             Number of scales used in the multiresolution transform
             default is 4.

         [-x]
             Write all scales separately as images with prefix 'scale_j' 
             (j being the scale number)

         [-b]
             Same as x option, but interpolate by block the scales.
             This option is valid only if the chosen multiresolution 
             transform is pyramidal (6,7,8,9,10,11,12). 

         [-i]
             Same as b option, but interpolate by a B3 spline the scales.
             This option is valid only if the chosen multiresolution 
             transform is pyramidal (6,7,8,9,10,11,12). 

         [-c iter]
             Iterative transformation. Iter = number of iterations. 
             This option is valid only if the chosen multiresolution  
             transform is pyramidal (6,7,8,9,10,11). The reconstruction 
             is not exact and we need few iterations. Generally, we take 3.
