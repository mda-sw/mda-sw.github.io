<b>The MR/1 Approach to Compression</b><p>

<ul>
<li> A range of wavelet and multiple scale morphological transforms are
available.  
<li> Very good results, incorporating robustness,
 are obtained with the pyramidal median transform.
<li> Extensive evaluation has been carried out, based on astrometrical 
and photometrical experiments on astronomical images.  
<li> Resolution-based progressive transmission has been prototyped.
<li> So too has applet-based client-side decompression and display.
<li> Even fairly large images (e.g. upwards of 800x800) take a minute or 
two (machine-dependent) for compression, and decompression is immediate.
<li> For various examples, evaluation, and to read further:
