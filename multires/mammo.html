<h1>Compression, for image transfer</h1>
<font color=black>
<p>
Image transfer is very common.  But images are defined by a considerable 
quantity of data, so that transfer can put strains on the communications 
lines supporting transfer.  We are working on various products for progressive
transmission.  Here, we see the tremedous gains which can be made through
image compression.  Shown is a mammogram image.  This was compressed to 
less than 3% of the original image's size.  Then the image was 
uncompressed, and is the second image shown below.

The original image was 1024x1024 and just over 4 MB in size.  The compressed
image was just 126 kB.  The images shown have been downsized to 512x512 for
convenience.  Visual fidelity was excellent, and the difference map between
input and output contained small noise values.
