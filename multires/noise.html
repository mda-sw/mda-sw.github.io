Statistical noise is ever-present.  To combat it, we must understand our
foe.  Such "understanding" is termed a model or a simulation.  It allows
us to demarcate what we want and what we not want - signal versus noise. 

<p>

The animated image shows a range of extended and point-like objects.  Then
a noisy version is shown.  Following that a noise-cleaned version is shown,
which approximates well to the original.  The difference between noisy and 
denoised shows an image which comes very close to pure (Gaussian) noise.
