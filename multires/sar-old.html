A SAR image taken by the European Space Agency's ERS satellite (ERS-1 or -2) 
is shown on 
the left.  It contains a lot of what is termed speckle, - the radar image is
deflected by foliage, soil, water, buildings.  Note the "sparkle" half way 
up towards the right - this is caused by some reasonably
large area more or less exactly reflecting back the radar signal.  The 
second image
is a filtered version of this image.   It could be used to 
much more easily pick out and demarcate areas of similar trees, or of urban
areas, for instance.

<b>Commands used</b><p>

<i>mr_filter -m 4  -t 10  in.fits out.fits</i> <br>
This entails use of (i) a multiplicative noise model for the filtering,
based on (ii) a pyramidal median transform.
<p>
Another command is <i>mr_rfilter</i> with options for noise modeling being
Rayleigh, log-transformed Rayleigh and square-transformed Rayleigh.
