$ mr_pfilter 

Usage: mr_pfilter options in_image out_image 

   where options =  
         [-a ascii_file]

         [-I image_file]
         a & I options can't be used together, 
         and one must be set. 

         [-w]

           write the following files
             xx_Wavelet.mr : contains the wavelet transform
              of the image.
             xx_Support.mr : contains the thresholded  wavelet transform.

         [-p]
             Detect only positive structure. Default is no.

         [-F first_detection_scale]
             First scale used for the detection 
             default is 1.

         [-q abaque_file]
              default is Abaque.fits.

         [-n number_of_scales]
             Number of scales used in the multiresolution transform
             default is 6.

         [-e minimum_of_events]
             Minimum number of events for a detection.
             default is 4

         [-f type_of_filtering]
              1: Iterative multiresolution thresholding 
              2: Adjoint operator applied to the multiresolution support  
              3: Multiresolution thresholding 
              default is Iterative multiresolution thresholding.

         [-l]
             Dilate the support

         [-k]
             Suppress isolated pixels in the support. Default is no.

         [-K]
             Suppress the last scale. Default is no.

         [-E Epsilon]
             Epsilon = precision for computing thresholds
                       (only used in case of Poisson noise with few events)
             default is 1.00e-05 

         [-i number_of_iterations]
             Maximum number of iterations
             default is 50.
