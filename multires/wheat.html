<b>Abstract:</b> A foundation is set forth for use of the wavelet 
transform as a
spatial analysis tool for modelling the geographic representation of
 economic and
financial measures used in agriculture. This provides a framework from which to
estimate a smooth nonparametric function which describes complex, multivariate
relationships embedded in spatial data, with the resulting maps conveying large
amounts of information in a familiar format. We illustrate this approach for
tasks which include the graphical presentation of information, density
estimation and wavelet-based nonparametric regression. A redundant wavelet
transform is used, and we detail the properties which make it particularly
appropriate for these objectives.

<a href="../pic/debt.gif"> Perspective plot (from south) of wavelet 
transform of 1995 Debt Capacity Utilization Ratio.</a>  Data from USDA.
Carried out in MR/1.

<a href="../pic/wheat.gif"> Result of wavelet regression, based on a 
heteroscedastic noise model, of 1995 wheat dependence data.</a>   Data 
from USDA.
The noise modeling and filtering was carried out in MR/1 and IDL, followed
by geo-referencing in ArcView.


<p>

<b> Commands used included:</b> <p>

<i> mr_visu -v 3</i> for the perspective plot. <p>

<i> mr_filter -m 8 -K -p -k</i> for wavelet regression with heteroscadistic
noise (-m 8), suppression of isolated detected pixels (-k), ignoring of 
the last smooth scale (-K), and detection of positive structure only (-p).
