Forecasting of financial time-series may be enhanced if we can get at the
underlying cycles and fluctuations.  Let's see what a wavelet transform can
provide.

<p>
But... "future" information has been used here to provide the wavelet 
coefficients at each scale.  This isn't right!!  The following gives a result
which respects time.  It is an additive decomposition.  It is not a wavelet
transform (the different scales are not of mean zero).  It is based on a 
sliding, and growing, window, on the basis of which a wavelet transform is 
carried out.

Based on the latter, the first reference cited below finds up to 86% correct
prediction of the trend - up or down - 5 days ahead.
