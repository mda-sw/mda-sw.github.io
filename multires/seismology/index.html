<h1>Multiresolution Analysis of a Seismological Signal</h1>

<h2> 1. Filtering by Denoising</h2>

The original data is shown in Fig. 1.

<p>

The noise is clearly non-stationary - it is low up to the event near time 
point 1000, and then from time point 1500 onwards is is moderately low.  
We used a non-stationary noise model, to clip noise on each level of a
multiscale transform.  The transform used was the so-called <i>&agrave; 
trous</i> ("with holes") wavelet transform.  The name &agrave; trous
is due to the gaps used in the algorithm (which we won't go further into,
here).  This wavelet transform is unlike widely used transforms due to 
Mallat, Daubechies, Haar and others in that it is <i>redundant</i>: the 
user gets a set of versions of the data, each of which are the same 
length as the original input data.  These are the sequence of resolution 
scales.  The values at each resolution scale are termed wavelet coefficients.
A final smooth version of the data (which we have termed residual, although
one must be careful that this word is used in statistics - in regression 
analysis - in a very different sense) gives the following nice property: 
at each time point, we can add together the wavelet coefficient values
at  the successive resolution scales, plus the corresponding value in
the smooth residual, to give exactly the input data value.  That suggests
immediately one way to filter the data: just drop one or more resolution
scale value entirely, and recreate the data.  

<p>

We could hope for a more sophisticated, statistically-based, alternative.
This is to put small-valued wavelet coefficients to zero, at all resolution
levels, if we feel that they are sufficiently small to be considered
as noise only.  That raises the question as to what noise is.  Questions
which this gives rise to include the following.  How does noise arise in the
first place?  What is meant by a statistical noise model?  How do we decide
(statistically) what our guidelines are, in order to decide what is and 
what is not noise?  What is the justification for carrying out denoising
at the multiple resolution levels provided by a wavelet transform?
An example of doing such denoising is shown in Fig. 2. This is not too 
bad in the regions to left and right of the earthquake event.  But we 
haven't made much inroad into this event interval.  The difference between 
original and filtered data (Fig. 3) shows this.  In fact, our program has
"protected" the earthquake event region, thinking that it comprised some
very significant values.  In a way this is true, and if we don't know how
otherwise to filter the earthquake event interval, then it is maybe best
to leave it alone.

<h2>2. Wavelet Transform Visualization</h2>

In the &agrave; trous wavelet transform we are using here
a wavelet function very like the 
Morlet wavelet, or the Mexican hat function: a bump in the centre, two 
negative sidelobes, symmetric.  It is not a bad choice for a wavelet 
function.  Others would argue that our redundant &agrave; trous wavelet 
transform doesn't allow for orthogonality between resolution levels.  We 
don't mind.  We feel it is a good choice for general open-minded 
information-seeking in data.

<p>

Fig. 4 shows the succession of wavelet resolution scales (from upper left,
to lower right) with the final smooth residual in the lower right.  
The number of scales (5 + residual here) is set by the user.  An interesting
thing happens by scale 5: the earthquake event in terms of time-interval
is no longer significant enough to survive.  It has almost disappeared.  

<p>

To demarcate the earthquake event, we are looking for a sharp transition from
what took place before, and maybe a sharp transition to normalcy which takes
place afterwards.  A term commonly applied to this in image and signal 
processing is edge detection.  We are looking for an edge, a sharp transition.
In statistical time series analysis, another term is sometimes used, a
change-point.  That term is more likely to imply a change from one state 
to another stable state. Our search for an edge, or multiple edges, in Fig.
1 is almost impossible, due to the noise in the data.  Noise filtering, as
seen in Fig. 2, did help somewhat, but not maybe as much as we would have
liked.  

<p>

We will find the different regime associated with the earthquake event by
an unusual approach, which we have found to work well in similar 
circumstances.  [It has also been used in (ref.) - I'm still looking...]  If 
information exists on a number of resolution scale, as will be the case
with very sharp exceptional information, then multiplying the information 
provided by these scales will accentuate the contrast.  The multiplication
is pixel-wise, or timestep-wise.  The result of doing this for all 
scales (therefore no "selective ignorance" by removing scales, such as the 
smooth residual, which we could have done) is shown in Fig. 5.  
The ordinate (vertical axis of the plot) scale
is huge.  We are interested in the relativities, and these show up the 
region of interest.  Also shown are indications of component shocks of the
earthquake event, and after-shocks.

To help the interpretation of this contrast-rich result in Fig. 5, 
Fig. 6 shows both it and the original data.

<h2>Appendix</h2>

The different tasks were carried out in IDL, an image processing package,
and our own package, MR1/MR2 which allows for a lot of operations in 
multiresolution image and signal analysis.  In addition a "snapshot" 
window grabber, and a public domain image viewer, xv, were used in our
Sun/Solaris environment. 

<p>

Steps followed:

Given multiple column data, we used the programming language
awk to quickly get just one 
column of values.  The time steps corresponding to the values were not
constant.  We ignored this and took the data as if it had constant 
time increments.  Then we translated it into FITS (an image or signal 
format, especially used in astronomy) using 
<pre> 
im1d_convert 1b.dat 1b.fits 
</pre>
There was no need to do this, beyond how we next read this into IDL:
<pre> 
s = readfits('1b.fits') 
</pre>
(The data could have been easily read as a stream of numbers into IDL.)
<p>
Next we use the filtering program 
<pre> 
mr1d_filter
</pre> for example as 
follows, where the non-stationary additive noise model is used (-m 5):
<pre> 
mr1d_filter, s, sfilt, opt='-m 5'
</pre>
This program does a few things which we don't want, in this work.  Firstly
it masks the very sharp movements associated with the earthquake, since 
these, it decides, are definitely not noise.  Secondly, it gives us back
positive values only, thinking this data signal is an astronomical 
spectrum (and so, negative values of collected light photons are somewhat
problematic and thus ignored).  We easily get around the latter problem:
<pre>
s2000 = fltarr(2048)
s2000 = s + 2000.0
mr1d_filter, s2000, s2000filt, opt='-m 5'
s2000filt = s2000filt - 2000.0
plot,s2000filt
plot,s2000filt - s
</pre>
The B<sub>3</sub> spline 6-level &agrave; trous wavelet transform is 
carried out as follows:
<pre>
mr1d_trans, s, strans, OPT="-n 6"
!p.multi=[0,3,2]
plot,strans.coef(*,0)
plot,strans.coef(*,1)
plot,strans.coef(*,2)
plot,strans.coef(*,3)
plot,strans.coef(*,4)
plot,strans.coef(*,5)
</pre>
The scale-based product contrast enhancement was carried out by:
<pre>
s1 = strans.coef(*,0)
s2 = strans.coef(*,1)
s3 = strans.coef(*,2)
s4 = strans.coef(*,3)
s5 = strans.coef(*,4)
s6 = strans.coef(*,5)
plot,s6*s5*s4*s3*s2*s1
</pre>
