<b>The MR/1 Approach to Deconvolution</b><p>

<ul>
<li> Detection of signal, and hence of noise, provides a very effective
way to <i>regularize</i> the solution.
<li> There is no need to guess or estimate any regularizing parameter.
<li> In fact, convergence is usually very rapid (a few iterations only).
<li> In such regularization through noise removal (and the use of 
variance stabilization if called for), the image so treated is the 
discrepancy image between given input image and the approximation to this
at any iteration (the "residual image").  
<i>So variance stabilization does not alter the 
basic nature of the inverse problem.</i>
<li> <i>The future:</i> software for maximum entropy deconvolution is nearing 
completion and will be part of the MR/2 package, due for release around 
mid-1999.  Multiscale entropy and noise modeling is used in this method.
