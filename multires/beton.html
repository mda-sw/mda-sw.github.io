<h1>Short Report on <br>
Image Analysis of Microstructure of Concrete</h1>

In Basheer et al. (1999) it is explained how concrete is taken as a 
three phase material, consisting of 
<ol>
<li> aggregate particles,
<li> cement matrix - paste, and 
<li> the interfacial transition zone (ITZ).
</ol>

The latter is found in the immediate vicinity of aggregate surface.  It 
differs from the bulk hydrated cement paste in morphology, composition and 
density.  Rather than the cement aggregate bond being the major factor
in the strength of concrete, it is asserted that the ITZ has a significant
effect on permeability and durability.   In Basheer et al. (1999) 
concrete samples of predefined composition were imaged, visually-defined
thresholding was carried out, and porosity measurements were made (based
on greyscale values) within specified thickness bands of coarse aggregate.

<p>  

The aggregate/paste/ITZ is examined using back-scattered electron (bse) 
images of polished sections of concrete.  Such Scanning Electron Microscope
(SEM) images are subject to significant speckle.  <a href="s702nz_512_he.gif">
Fig. 1</a> shows an example, which is a 512x512 cutout of a larger 
1024x1024 image, here shown histogram-equalized.  

<p>

We see two ways to put the procedure of Basheer et al. (1999) 
on a more effective footing: firstly,
define the thresholds based on distribution mixture modeling of the 
image greyscale intensity distribution; and, secondly, since this cannot
be feasibly done on the available speckled images, first remove this speckle.

<p>

Speckle is multiplicative noise, and is typical of synthetic aperture 
radar (SAR) or acoustic images. The statistical modeling of speckle is
discussed in Section 5.3 of MR (1999).  We used the MR/1 package (MR, 1999) 
to  despeckle the image shown in Fig. 1.  The result is shown in 
<a href="s702nz_n3_t2_512_he.gif">Fig. 2</a> for  the same 512x512 
area.  Despeckling the 1024x1024 image takes a few seconds elapsed time 
on a Sun UltraSparc 10.  A wavelet transform is used, with noise 
modeling, to allow for speckle filtering on a range of resolution 
scales.  

<p>

To compare the input and despeckled output images, we show a 64x64 
subregion here side by side.  As before, these images are shown 
histogram-equalized to improve the contrast.

<p>

The difference in intensity distribution in these images is quite
significant.  <a href="s702nz_hist_plot.gif">Fig. 3</a> shows the 
intensity distribution of the given SEM image.  It is clear than there
is little by way of heuristic pointers towards where one should place 
thresholds leading to image segmentation.  
<a href="s702nz_n3_t2_hist_plot.gif">Fig. 4</a> shows the intensity 
distribution, again based on the 1024x1024 image, following filtering
to remove speckle.  Here, the distribution is much more amenable to the 
fitting of Gaussians.  

<p>

We may comfortably hypothesize that, by the law
of large numbers, the different constituents of the image each follow a
Gaussian distribution.  It is our task to disentangle these, in most cases
partially, superimposed Gaussians.  This can be done through an iterative
fitting procedure (Celeux and Govaert, 1995). In Campbell et al. (1999),
this mixture model fitting approach was used for setting thresholds in 
images containing various types of production faults in textiles.
Furthermore in Campbell et al. (1999), we select the best model - 
helping significantly in selecting the best thresholds - by use of a 
Bayesian model selection procedure.  One appropriate measure is the 
BIC (Bayes Information Criterion), the theory of which was developed in 
Kass and Raftery (1995).  

<p>

Overall, this is a very effective procedure, 
and since the intensity distribution, only, is being processed it is highly 
efficient (a second or two on a normal workstation).   It is an approach 
which we believe will lead to a solution which is quite robust for 
varying lighting conditions, or compositions of the concrete being studied.  
It is, as we have seen, capable of providing an objective procedure for the
setting of the thresholds.  Finally, it requires, as noted, that the 
images be despeckled prior to analysis.
