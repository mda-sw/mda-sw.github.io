<h1>Modeling and Forecasting Web Traffic</h1>
<font color=black>
<p>

Understanding traffic flows is always important, for observation of 
performance, and for planning.  Various types of telecommunications traffic
have been shown to be chaotic, and hence awkward to simply describe even if
averaged over a period of time.  Being able to forecast accurately would 
therefore be quite valuable - to allow for sudden demands on the system, or
to take preemptive action through aggresive prefetching.  The plot below shows
some hourly Web hit data.

The superimpostion of scales and of fluctuations or cycles is potentially 
very valuable.  It allows the underlying signal to be disentangled and 
some components to be more easily modeled and predicted compared to others.
The following plots related to Web hits at one minute intervals.  Shown are
forecasts in the continuous line, and the original data in the dotted line.
From upper left to bottom we have the first, second, third, fourth and 
residual scales.  The forecasting method used here was an innovative dynamic
recurrent connectionist method.
