The galaxy cluster A2390 is at a redshift of 0.231.  The first image above 
was obtained with the ROSAT X-ray spacecraft.  The resolution is one arc 
second per pixel, with a total number of photons equal to 13506, based on an 
integration time of 8.5 hours.  The background level is about 0.04 photons
per pixel.  <p>
It is obvious that the image cannot be used directly and that some processing
is required before any analysis.  The standard method consists of 
convolving the image with a Gaussian.  The second image above shows the 
result of doing this.  With much residual noise, it is difficult to see any
structure. <p>
The final image above shows the image after wavelet filtering.  Faint 
X-ray emission structures are seen, related to gravitational amplification
phenomena obervable in the visible wavelength range.

The Beta Pictoris image (first image) was obtained by integrating on-source
for 5 hours using a mid-infrared camera (TIMMI, on the ESO 3.6m telescope 
at La Silla, Chile).  The raw image has a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 80. 
It is strongly blurred by a combination of seeing, diffraction 
(0.7 arcsec on a 3m-class telescope) and additive Gaussian noise.  The initial
disk shape has been lost following convolution with the point spread 
function.  Thus we need to deconvolve  the image to get the best information
about the object - the exact profile and thickness of the disk - and 
subsequently to compare results to models of thermal dust emission.
<p>
Noise filtering alone will show up the disk quite well.  For detection of 
faint structures in the disk, one can calculate that the use of such 
filtering on this image provides a gain of observing time of a factor of
around 60.  The deconvolved image (second image above) shows that 
the disk is extended at 10 microns and on close examination can be seen 
to be asymmetrical.  The multiscale 
entropy method is more effective for regularizing than other standard
methods, and leads to good reconstruction of the faintest structures of 
the dust disk.
