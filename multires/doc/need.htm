Scale and Resolution in Image and Data Analysis</font></h1> 
<h1><font color="#0000FF">- For New Levels of
Innovation and Performance</font></h1>
<p>

<p><font size=+3>T</font>he reasons why you should consider multiresolution
methods are all to do with squeezing performance out of your work.  The
theory of wavelet and multiscale analysis is well-represented by a growing
wealth of literature.  What is equally if not more challenging is to 
demonstrably show that these new methods offer substantial improvements 
in your work.  Check out the results of studies using these novel methods.
You are sure to find case-studies close to your problem, and your data.
<b><font color="#FF0000">MR/1 is unique in its support of many of the 
topics sketched out below.</font></b>

<p><font size=+3>H</font>ere are some of the ways you can keep a step - or
more - ahead of the competition.

<ul>
<li> <b>Noise modelling.</b>  
Among noise models supported are: Gaussian, and
Gaussian and low-count Poisson models, typical of CCD detectors; sparse and
low-count Poisson, typical of X-ray images, of point pattern data, and of
document-term incidence data; non-stationary additive noise; stationary and
non-stationary multiplicative noise; robust treatment of undefined 
stationary noise; speckle removal;
and a locally adaptive strategy for undefined noise.
<p>
Such noise modelling is part and parcel of all multiscale methods.  You will
find such comprehensive noise modelling in no other software package.
Application domains include 
medical imaging, high-peformance image processing in 
physics and astronomy, surface analysis in materials science, ...
<p>

<li> <b>Visualization of scientific and engineering data.</b>  MR/1 goes
straight to the essentials in multiresolution visualization.  Included
are linear and B-spline &agrave; trous
wavelet transforms, wavelet transforms 
of Mallat, Feauveau and Haar, pyramidal and redundant wavelet transforms,
and a range of non-wavelet multiresolution transforms - morphological
median, morphological min-max, pyramidal Laplacian, and various other methods.
<p>
You can perform exactly the desired processing on the different resolution
scales.  Application domains include fluid dynamics, faint feature 
detection and 
measurement, handling variable background and superimposed information, ...
<p>
The multiscale support image can be easily obtained - a very powerful 
visualization aid.
<p>
<b>Filtering.</b>  Many filtering methods can be used with these multiscale
transforms.  These include: hard, soft and iterative thresholding; median,
average and B-spline filtering; and many more.
<p>
<b>2D image and 1D signals</b> are covered by these methods.
<p>
<b>Image restoration or deconvolution</b> or deblurring.  Common methods 
are often notoriously user-unfriendly and badly behaved - denoising is an 
excellent way to regularize the result.
<p>
<li> <b>Blob analysis</b> and counting, multiple resolution object 
detection and characterization.  Multiple resolution image segmentation.
Multiple resolution edge detection.  
<p>
<li> <b>Image registration</b> - the best spatial fit between two images
of approximately the same scene, with various deformation models, and
support for up to 2nd order interpolation of the fit.  
<p>
Applications to Earth observation images, or other images taken with different
detectors, with or without the same image resolution.  
<p>
<li> <b>Image compression.</b>  Various multiscale and wavelet options are 
available, together with all-important noise-modelling.  Decompression 
includes options for selective reconstruction of the image, allowing use 
as a tool for progressive transmission via the Web.  
<p>
<li> <b>IDL, PV-Wave routines</b>.  Many routines are available for IDL
(Research Systems Inc.) and PV-Wave (Visual Numerics Inc.), interfacing 
the above-mentioned analysis methods and transforms. 
<p>
<li> Utility programs are available for the following: 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Image simulation</b> based on a given image.  
The image can have random
shot and/or Gaussian noise added, and can be blurred with a given instrument
response function.  
<li> <b>Mathematical morphology</b> 
operations - erode, dilate, opening, closing,
with different shapes and sizes of structuring elements.
<li> Image thinning: determine the <b>morphological skeleton</b> of a 2-level 
(black and white) image.
<li> <b>Fast Fourier transform (FFT)</b> on real or complex data.
<li> <b>Image conversion</b> 
between a range of formats. Rescaling to 8 bits per
pixel is performed for formats (e.g. GIF) requiring this.  A 32-bit precision
FITS format is fully supported in all routines, as is a simple format to 
accommodate data in byte, short integer, integer, floating and double precision
floating formats.
</ul>
</ul>

MR/1 consists of some 100,000 lines of C++, and 5000 lines in IDL.
