is a story which begins in the distant reaches of the Universe... 
and which comes rapidly down to Earth.

<p><font size=+3>A</font>stronomy 
as a discipline has many lessons for other disciplines.  
Massive datasets are commonly handled, information must be distilled
from incredible amounts of noise and clutter, and it has been a multimedia
discipline long before the term became commonplace.  Astronomy has 
been in the business of spinning off and feeding other disciplines for
a long time.  Substantial branches of statistics - witness Gauss - have
come from astronomy, as have other sciences based on measurement.  
Optics has benefited amazingly.  Astronomers became major users of the
Web as soon as browser technology took off the launch-pad in 1993.  
They are continuing this now with far-reaching online information 
services and electronic publishing.  As a launch-site for new ideas
and new technologies, it is difficult to beat the power and the energy
which have always been associated with astronomy.  

<p><font size=+3>I</font>t 
is not surprising therefore that the early stages of our work lie 
in astronomy.  Albert Bijaoui, from Nice Observatory in France, has 
carried out mould-breaking work on large-scale structures in the Universe.  
In astronomy, he is "Mr Signal Processing" par excellence.  His activities
outside of astronomy have included Earth observation and geophysics.  
Bijaoui has produced a long line of some of the brightest and the best 
doctoral students over the years.  Jean-Luc Starck worked with Bijaoui.
An outstanding software engineer and astronomer, he now works at the 
CEA near Paris, the French national center for nuclear power which has
always had very major astrophysics and medical divisions.  Starck was
working at the European Southern Observatory in Munich, Germany, when he
met Fionn Murtagh.  Spanning the disciplines of engineering, statistics
and computer science, Murtagh worked with the Space Science Department 
of the European Space Agency for many years.  He now holds Professorships
at the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland and at the Universit&eacute;
Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France.   Starck, Murtagh and Bijaoui are
the authors of a 320-page book entitled "Image and Data Analysis: The
Multiscale Approach" which has recently been published by Cambridge 
University Press in hardback and paperback. 

<p><font size=+3>T</font>he 
secrets of cosmological structures are not easy to unravel, but nor
also are the practical tasks of life and labor which are closer to home.
The handling of data and information is central to every area of science
and technology.  That is why new ways of treating data and information
may well have breakthrough qualities.  Multiscale methods at first sight
appear imaginative and attractive in their multifaceted qualities.  They
can be understood and explained in so many different ways.  This alone
makes them strange and new.  

<p><font size=+3>A</font> 
particular line of inquiry has been pursued in our work, which we
will briefly sketch out.  Various classes of multiscale transform have
been studied and - most of all - applied in varied practical settings 
with proven success.  An approach to describing multiscale 
transforms is as follows.  We seek to disentangle structure on different
resolution scales in our observed image or other data.  After all, so 
much of real life is a matter of phenomena being superimposed scale upon
scale, rather like the rocks and soil which lie under our feet.  It 
seems so also in the Universe, in that we have structures of galaxies, 
galaxies themselves, and stellar systems in all sorts of wonderful 
combinations.  As it is with physical systems, so also with environmental
and human ones.  Consider for instance the meteorological phenomena which 
must be compounded before we get what we can praise or curse in daily
weather patterns.  Or consider the business and other cycles which are 
compounded in order to give us our international economy.  We know that 
what we must deal with - understand and manage - are related to such 
scales.  But is there a methodology available which will semi-automatically
help us to find underlying components in our observed data?  

<p><font size=+3>M</font>ultiscale 
transforms go a considerable distance in helping us to tackle
such issues.  They encompass wavelet transforms.  Consider what seems like
an unreasonable thing to do.  An image, A, is deliberately blurred to 
yield B.  C, the difference between A and B, reveals those structures 
present in A but absent in B because they are too small to survive the 
effects of the blurring.  C is obtained from A as part of a wavelet 
transform or, more generally, a multiscale transform.  Next, E is created
as the difference between B and a blurred version of B which we will call D.
By repeating this process several times, deeper and deeper levels of 
structure in an image can be revealed.  What is more, we can show that 
the original image, A, can be expressed as an additive combination of
C + E + ...  This is a very appealing result.  We have succeeded in 
unpeeling layers of reality.  This can be done very efficiently, too, since
everything described so far is very simple.  Whether the layers of reality
that we have uncovered are "real" is something we are not terribly 
interested in.  Our goal is very pragmatic: unpeel reality, obtaining a 
set of resolution scales, and then see if we can make practical use of
such a decomposition of our data. 

<p><font size=+3>T</font>he 
practical uses of doing such things with our data include the 
following.  

<ul>
<li> Filtering - removing background, or noise, from the data.  
<li> Compression - principally through separating out the noise which is 
              the major issue in how well we can compress data.
<li> Restoration - or deblurring, or more fancifully termed deconvolution.
<li> Visualization - "a picture paints a thousand words".
<li> Information fusion - we address the global issues first.
<li> Image analysis - finding what we need to find in our data, which is 
              so often scale-dependent.
<li> Mirroring our, human, visual and mental processes, in observing and 
              interpreting phenomena simultaneously at multiple scales.
</ul>

<p><font size=+3>T</font>he 
domains of application are myriad.  A small sample follows.

<ul>
<li> We have started with astronomy, so let us mention just a few themes:
  the understanding of large-scale cosmological structures, studying 
  X-ray images, finding specified shapes and patterns in large image
  databases, deblurring Hubble Space Telescope images before 
  refurbishment, and so on. 
<li> Materials science, crystallography.
<li> Medicine - mammography, ultrasound imagery.
<li> Correlation and fusion of multiple Earth observation images observed 
  with remote sensing satellites.
<li> Visualizing and analyzing massive multimedia and hypertext datasets.
<li> Finding faint features or desired shapes and patterns in our data.  
<li> Forecasting financial flows and telecommunications traffic.
</ul>

<p><font size=+3>J</font>ust 
one important aspect of these methodological and software products
is refined modelling of the noise properties of one's data.  There is 
probably no better source of results in this area, anywhere, as our work
as regard to 
breadth and depth of treatment of so many noise distributions.  Practical
strategies, and clearly validated outcomes, are plentiful in this work
of ours.

<p><font size=+3>T</font>he 
image compression technology developed here is due to be widely 
used in the very near future.  It will be a component part of an online
sky atlas project currently nearing completion at Strasbourg Astronomical
Observatory, which is code-named Aladin.  This multimedia project 
encompasses data and information fusion on a massive scale.

<p><font size=+3>T</font>he 
work accomplished so far has all the hall-marks of taking many 
scientific and engineering disciplines a substantial step forward, in 
terms of effectiveness and ease of use 
in the day-to-day activities of cranking 
out new results.  The MR/1 Software Package accompanies the book 
referred to above, and goes much further in functionality in many cases.
MR/1 consists of about 100,000 lines of C++ code, supports various image and 
data input formats, includes about 5000 lines of IDL code, 
and is available for a wide range of scientific and
engineering operating systems and platforms.  Further information on it
