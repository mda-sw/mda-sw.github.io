<ul>
<li> An image of the 
<a href="../pic/derry0.jpg">city of Derry</a> (Londonderry), Northern Ireland,
population 100,000, showing
the River Foyle, where it becomes Lough Foyle as it flows northwards into
the Atlantic Ocean.  The two bridges can be noted, the short Craigavon Bridge 
in the urban area, and the long Foyle Bridge in the upper part of this scene.  
The image was derived from a SPOT image, is of dimensions 512x512, and dates 
from mid-May 1987.

<li> The basis for specifying roads and boundaries of fields and buildings
using <a href="../pic/derry1.jpg">the first scale of a multiscale 
morphological (minmax) transform</a>.

<li> The <a href="../pic/derry2.jpg">"big picture" - the sum of remaining
scales resulting from a  multiscale 
morphological (minmax) transform</a>.

</ul>

Adding the latter two images gives the input image.  (The three 
JPEG images are respectively 64, 99 and 59 kB in size.)
